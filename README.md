Professional desktop application for flood detection using computer vision, image processing, and geospatial raster analysis.

FloodVision compares two images of the same location ("Before" and "After") and automatically detects newly flooded areas.

The current stable release v0.9.0 provides multispectral GeoTIFF processing, Sentinel-2 support, spectral indices, and NoData-aware spectral water detection. Development in v0.9.1 focuses on improving NDWI band resolution, validity-mask handling, and the reliability of the spectral processing architecture.

### GeoTIFF Information Panel

FloodVision provides visible geospatial metadata directly in the desktop application.

When browsing a processed GeoTIFF result, the GeoTIFF Information Panel automatically displays:

* Coordinate Reference System (CRS)
* EPSG code
* Raster width and height
* Number of raster bands
* Pixel resolution
* NoData value
* Raster bounds

For standard images without geospatial metadata, the panel displays a neutral information state.

The panel is implemented as a dedicated PySide6 dock widget and automatically updates when navigating between processed image pairs.
